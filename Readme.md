Some image processing tools for FITS files
==========================================

- different matrix operations (gauss, LoG, Sobel, Prewitt, Scharr)
- sum, difference
- posterisation, binarisation
- 4- and 8-connected components search (by threshold given)
- FITS records manipulation
- image statistics calculation
- image flipping
- Median filter with changing radius (from 0 - cross 3x3 to any larger)
- Adaptive median filter (not ready)
